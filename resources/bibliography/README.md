# Bibliography

This directory contains bibliographic references and citation data.

## Reference management
- Place your `.bib` files here
- Each file should be named descriptively (e.g., `psychology.bib`, `neuroscience.bib`)
- Keep the reference list updated and well-organized
- Include DOIs or stable URLs when available
- Follow the APA/DGPs citation style as outlined in the guidelines

## Full-text storage
Organize source PDFs according to the rule of thumb:
- `books/` &rarr; scanned/online books in PDF format
- `articles/` &rarr; journal articles, conference papers
- `other/` &rarr; reports, web-hosted PDFs, whitepapers, etc.
